# Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure the elytron security
subsystem when configuring CLIENT-CERT authentication with a root
certificate authority (CA), an intermediate CA, a server certificate
and private key, and a client certificate and private key.  The
CAs, server, and client certificates can be generated using the
[intranet-test-certs](https://github.com/rlucente-se-jboss/intranet-test-certs) project.

# Prerequisites
Please make sure that the `certs` and the `dist` directories are
populated according to their respective README.md.
